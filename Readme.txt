Challenge Statement

Cross-blogs is a backend blogging application written by a startup company called WritingForAll. It allows users to create / update / delete their articles, accepting comments for each article.

Notes:
- Articles have a 120 character limit for their title, and a 32k limit for their body.
- The frontend application is excluded from the current scope. It is a separate, fully-functional application handled by another team, so we do not want to modify it.


Your tasks:
- Increase unit test coverage to reach 70%, achieving more than 70% will only consume your valuable time without extra score.
- Find bugs and fix them, hint: we provided Cross-Blogs application in a good structure, so no need to spend your valuable time on structure modifications,  just focus on fixing bugs.
- Articles search endpoint is very slow, please optimize it.
- Recently Crossover acquired Cross-Blogs and found that 
	Cross-Socials -it is another project for social networking owned by crossover - is very eligible to promote Cross-Blogs,  
	they want to display articles only in Cross-Socials news feed without comments using get article endpoint, 
	the problem is Cross-Blogs traffic was 10M page views per day while Cross-Socials page views are 900M per day, 
	Your goal is to scale Cross-Blogs app to serve expected traffic, 
	Cross-Blogs web application was hosted in a single huge AWS node and 
	the node was loaded for 10M per dayâ€™s traffic which makes increasing node size not a valid option, 
	the conclusion is we need to have multi nodes of Cross-Blogs, and offload database.
    
    Notes about last task:
    - Perform required modifications in application level, and in case application modifications requires another 3rd party 
      please add it to docker-compose.yml file.
    - Database replication is not required in this task.
    - Pay attention to articles only, and feel free to exclude comments from current scope of scaling as
      comments will not appear in Cross-Social at all.
